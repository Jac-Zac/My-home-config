## Customizations

- If you want neofetch just run ```brew install neofetch ``` and I suggest to add lolcat ```brew install lolcat ```
- You can change the .zshrc and I suggest to follow the commnets
- You can change the .vimrc file
- I suggest to uncomment some stuff in the .zshrc -> but do not forget to ```brew install lsd```
- You have to allow Alacritty terminal to work on your mac
- Beautiful dynamic wallpapers -> [First](https://dynamicwallpaper.club/wallpaper/6df38eo4nym),[Second](https://dynamicwallpaper.club/wallpaper/jculsb683ok)
