	This configuration repo contains everything to set up my terminal from scratch in two scripts. It also has a very easy way to update your old configuration to keep it up to date.

## Motivation üí≠

_I mainly created this to always have my config with me, but I would really be happy if anybody wanted to try it. Furthermore I think that if I can help someone with this it is worth shearing it._

### Updating üìÖ

**Have you already installed everything but your version lack behind ?** :thinking:

_You should always keep your configuration up to date, luckily there is a straightforward and noob-proof solution._

<details>
<summary><strong>Instruction to update</strong></summary>

> If you wish to update your current configuration to the latest updates you can just follow the simple instructions that follows.

- You have to go to the "My-home-config" directory
		 
	  cd My-home-config

- Pull the updates from Github latest version  

	  git pull

- This command give execute permission to the script

	  chmod +x update.sh

- This command run the update script

	  ./update.sh 

</details>

### Customizations üîß

##### This setup is made for macOS, and perhaps GNU\Linux in the future
> YouTube from the terminal can be watched thanks to [`ytfzf`](https://github.com/pystardust/ytfzf)

<details>
	<summary><strong>System Preferences</strong></summary>

- I also suggest to Automatically Hide & Show the Menu Bar and also set show scroll bar in all the application only when scrolling (system Preferences -> General)
- Absolutely disable wallpaper tinting in windows inside system preferences > general on macOS Big Sur 

</details>

<details>
	<summary><strong>Edit you shell configurations</strong></summary>

> Shell configurations

_If you want you can go to [`~/.config/zsh`](.config/zsh) to edit your [`.zshrc`](.config/zsh/.zshrc) and you can uncomment lines._
_You can also edit your prompt in the [`~/.config/zsh/.p10k.zsh`](.config/zsh/.p10k.zsh)_

</details>

<details>
	<summary><strong>iTerm configuration</strong></summary>

> Everything related to my iTerm

**I use iTerm in minimal mode with tab bar on the bottom and borderless setting.**

If you'd like to see images on iTerm you can use [`imgcat`](https://pypi.org/project/imgcat/).

_You can also go to your iTerm preferences and import the iTerm_profile.json that you can find in the cloned directory_

> To have a bit of space I also sugguest to add 20px of padding 

</details>

<details>
	<summary><strong>Better file listing</strong></summary>

> I have aliased ls to [`lsd`](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd), to make it look better and have icons_

_If you are not interested in using it just uncomment the following line in the .zshrc file_

	alias ls="lsd"

</details>

<details>
	<summary><strong>My nvim confiuguration</strong></summary>

> This configurations hash a sort of Latex integrated with [`markdown-preview`](https://github.com/instant-markdown/vim-instant-markdown)! 

	vim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim

##### And then run the command ``:PlugInstall``

</details>

## Installation :memo:

> You have to be in zsh shell for this installation, if you are running an old version of macOS you might need to switch away from bash

#### Step by step instructions 

1. This is to clone the repository ‚è≥ 

```
git clone https://github.com/Jac-Zac/My-home-config.git
```

2. This allows you to go to the correct directory

```
cd My-home-config
```

3. This command give execute permission to the script

```
chmod +x installer.sh 
```

4. Run the first script

```
./installer.sh 
```

> You should close your terminal windows and open a new one, to reload the configurations

**Installation Completed !**

## Other things üìö

**I also use ohmyzsh** to learn more and support them go to -> [`ohmyzsh`](https://ohmyz.sh/)
Now I will be focusing on other things but also better my configuration for M1 Mac. For the README.md I took inspiration from [this repo](https://github.com/owl4ce/dotfiles)

<h2 align="center">

	Arch Linux
</h2>

<em><p align="center">This is what a little showcase</p></em>


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jac-Zac/My-home-config/master/.assets/Arch_rice.jpg"/>

<em><p align="center"> 
Now I also have a configuration for my Raspberry pi 4 running Arch with [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) as a WM and I'm loving it so far, thus I'm thinking of posting that too in the future.
I think I will do it if some asks for it
