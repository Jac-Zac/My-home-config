## Motivation üí≠

_I mainly created this to always have my config with me, but I would really be happy if anybody wanted to try it. Furthermore I think that if I can help someone with this it is worth sharing it._

### Install only brew üç∫

*If you only need brew you can install it on your system whether it is x86_64 or arm just run this one-liner*

```bash
curl -SL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jac-Zac/My-home-config/master/installer.sh >> installer.sh ; chmod +x installer.sh; ./installer.sh -b; rm installer.sh
```

### Updating :calendar:

**Have you already installed everything but your version lack behind ?** :thinking:

_You should always keep your configuration up to date, luckily there is a straightforward and noob-proof solution._

<details>
<summary><strong>Instruction to update</strong></summary>

> If you wish to update your current configuration to the latest updates you can just follow the simple instructions that follows.

- You have to go to the "My-home-config" directory
		 
	  cd My-home-config

- Pull the updates from Github latest version  

	  git pull

- This command run the install script in update mode

	  ./installer.sh -u

</details>

### Customizations üîß

##### This setup is made for macOS, and perhaps GNU\Linux in the future
> YouTube from the terminal can be watched thanks to [`ytfzf`](https://github.com/pystardust/ytfzf)

<details>
	<summary><strong>System Preferences</strong></summary>

> I'd like to load all of those preferences automatically with the default command in the future

- I also suggest to Automatically Hide & Show the Menu Bar and also set show scroll bar in all the application only when scrolling (system Preferences -> General)
- Absolutely disable wallpaper tinting in windows inside system preferences > general on macOS Big Sur

<details>
	<summary><strong>Edit you shell configurations</strong></summary>

> Shell configurations

_If you want you can go to [`~/.config/zsh`](.config/zsh) to edit your [`.zshrc`](.config/zsh/.zshrc) and you can uncomment lines._
_You can also edit your prompt in the [`~/.config/zsh/.p10k.zsh`](.config/zsh/.p10k.zsh)_

![showcase](.assets/prompt.png)

</details>

<details>
	<summary><strong>iTerm configuration</strong></summary>

> Everything related to my iTerm

**I use iTerm in minimal mode with tab bar on the bottom and borderless setting.**

If you'd like to see images on iTerm you can use [`imgcat`](https://pypi.org/project/imgcat/).

![showcase](.assets/iterm.png)

*You can also go to your iTerm preferences and import the iTerm_profile.json that you can find in the cloned directory*

> To have a bit of space I also suggest to add 20px of padding, set it under advanced >  margin

</details>

<details>
	<summary><strong>Firefox Configuration</strong></summary>

> My firefox configuration allows me to browse the web with more freedom then ever before. Furthermore use 1.1.1.1 as your DNS Server

*I use [nord theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nord-theme-cool/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) and I changed my new tabs to black pages.*


- [`zuBlock Origin`](https://ublockorigin.com) 
- [`LocalCDN`](https://www.localcdn.org/)
- [`HTTPS Everywhere`](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere)
- [`Privacy Badger`](https://privacybadger.org/)
- [`SponsorBlock`](https://sponsor.ajay.app/)
- [`Temp Mail`](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/temp-mail/)
- [`Stylus`](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)

> And use [nord theme for youtube](https://github.com/MajesticWaffle/Youtube-Nord-Theme) and this for [whatsapp](https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp)

##### Set this value in your [about:config](about:config) to true
```
toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets = true
```
> Then follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UhsLlJs9Jg) tutorial, and use copy the chrome directory from my file or go to [this Github page](https://github.com/andreasgrafen/ag.proton)

</details>

<details>
	<summary><strong>Better file listing</strong></summary>

> I have aliased ls to [`lsd`](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd), to make it look better and have icons

![showcase](.assets/lsd.png)

*If you are not interested in using it just uncomment the following line in the .zshrc file*

	alias ls="lsd"

</details>

<details>
	<summary><strong>My nvim confiuguration</strong></summary>

![showcase](.assets/nvim.png)

> This configurations has a sort of Latex integrated with [`markdown-preview`](https://github.com/instant-markdown/vim-instant-markdown)! 

_I have also added latex compiling on the fly with_ [`neotex`](https://github.com/donRaphaco/neotex), and [`zathura`](https://github.com/zegervdv/homebrew-zathura)

	vim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim

##### And then run the command ``:PlugInstall``

</details>

## Installation :memo:

> You have to be in zsh shell for this installation, if you are running an old version of macOS you might need to switch away from bash

#### Step by step instructions 

1. This is to clone the repository without old commits, and enter inside it ‚è≥ 

```
git clone https://github.com/Jac-Zac/My-home-config.git --depth=1 && cd My-home-config
```

2. This command give execute permission to the script

```
chmod +x installer.sh 
```

3. Run the script. If you want to get some more information you can start by running `./installer -h`

```
./installer.sh
```
> You should close your terminal windows and open a new one, to reload the configurations

*You can run ```.\install -s``` to only install the command prompt configurations*

**Installation Completed !**

## Maintenance :gear:

#### Routines you should implement into your mac usage

*You should try to keep your system up to date, also follow the [`instruction under the updating section`](#Updating-calendar)*

###### And I also use: 

- [`this`](https://github.com/mengfeng/clean-my-mac) script to clean up any junk that has build up.
- [`ncdu`](https://github.com/rofl0r/ncdu) to check for big files and directory that I can delete

#### Checking for malware 

Moreover it is always a good measure to check if you have any malware installed by using [`clamav`](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav).

###### To use it just run:

```
sudo freshclam
```
> If you get an error try copy the sample configuration file to a new file and comment out `Example` side the file.

###### Wait for it to finish and then:

```
sudo clamscan -r --bell -i /
```

## Keybinds

I use <kbd>command</kbd> AKA super key (on GNU/Linux) as my main modifier

#### Keyboard ‚å®Ô∏è

| Keybind | Action |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>command + shift + enter</kbd> | Spawn terminal |
| <kbd>command + enter</kbd> | Swap windows |
| <kbd>command + b</kbd> | Open firefox nightly |
| <kbd>command + p</kbd> | Launch Alfred |
| <kbd>command + w</kbd> | Close Window |
| <kbd>command + q</kbd> | Close Application |
| <kbd>cotrol + [1-0]</kbd> | Change workspace |
| <kbd>command + shift + [1-0]</kbd> | Move focused client to workspace |
| <kbd>command + shift + [hjkl]</kbd> | Resize client |
| <kbd>command + [hjkl]</kbd> | Change focus by direction |
| <kbd>alt + f</kbd> | Set window to floating mode |


## Other things üìö

I'd like to slowly switch aways from powerlevel10k to get a faster feeling shell, but now I will be focusing on other things but also better my configuration for M1 Mac. For the README.md I took inspiration from [this repo](https://github.com/owl4ce/dotfiles), and for the bootstrap script I took inspiration from [this repo instead](https://github.com/natelandau/dotfiles).
I have also started using [`Zsh Vi Mode`](https://github.com/jeffreytse/zsh-vi-mode), in my shell prompt.
In conclusion I have started using [expose](https://github.com/beyondcode/expose) instead of ngrok to create secure tunnels, by using the command `expose --auth=my_token`.
I have just added support for other Linux distros at least to have a decent configuration.
I also have many aliases for example if you write `intel` in front of any command it will run the under Rosetta.

    sudo nvram boot-args=-arm64e_preview_abi

Create a certificate and compile yabai to then switch it s

Now I also have a configuration for my Raspberry pi 4 running Arch with [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) as a WM and I'm loving it so far, thus I'm thinking of posting that too in the future.
I think I will do it if some asks for it
