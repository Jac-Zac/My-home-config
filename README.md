<p align="center">
	This configuration repo contains everything to set up my terminal from scratch in two scripts. It also has a very easy way to update your old configuration to keep it up to date.

	Motivation üí≠
</h2>

<p align="center">
I mainly created this to always have my config with me, but I would really be happy if anybody wanted to try it. Furthermore I think that if I can help someone with this it is worth shearing it.

### Customizations üîß

- I use Iterm in minimal mode with tab bar on the bottom, and add borderless and with 20 padding
- To show images on iTerm I use [`imgcat`](https://pypi.org/project/imgcat/)
- YouTube from the terminal can be watched thanks to [`ytfzf`](https://github.com/pystardust/ytfzf)
- If you want you can go to [`~/.config/zsh`](/config/zsh) to edit your [`.zshrc`](config/zsh/.zshrc) and you can uncomment lines.
- I have aliased `ls` to `lsd` just because I think it looks better. 
- I also suggest to Automatically Hide & Show the Menu Bar and also set show scroll bar in all the application only when scrolling (system Preferences -> General)
- Absolutely disable wallpaper tinting in windows inside system preferences > general on macOS Big Sur 

### My nvim configuration if you want to load them
