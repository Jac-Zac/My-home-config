## CLOSE YOUR TERMINAL WINDOWS AND OPEN A NEW ONE

**I suggest to install also** [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/)

**Other thing I suggest to have the same terminla style and look:**

- If you want my same color theme go to -> https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-iterm2 
- I suggest to go to -> http://terminal.sexy (to decide the color palette)

## Customizations

- I suggest to add lolcat ```brew install lolcat ``` which can be used with neofetch 
- If you want you can go to ~/.config/zsh to edit your .zshrc -> and you can uncomment lines 
- You can change the .vimrc file located inside the .vim folder in the home directoty 
- If you want to use ```lsd``` as your ```ls``` uncomment the alias in the zshrc and do not forget to to use a nerd font 
- To install SF Mono nerd font go to ```https://github.com/epk/SF-Mono-Nerd-Font``` and follow the install
- I use iTerm in minimal mode with tab bar on the bootom 
- Beautiful dynamic wallpapers -> [First](https://dynamicwallpaper.club/wallpaper/6df38eo4nym),[Second](https://dynamicwallpaper.club/wallpaper/jculsb683ok)
- I also suggest to Automatically Hide & Show the Menu Bar and also set show scroll bar in all the application only when scrolling (system Preferences -> General)
